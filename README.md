# Immersive AI

This repository contains the code I wrote for a project we called "Immersive AI".  
You will find basic Tensorflow scripts and attempts to make voice recognition (including Tensorflow scripts and data preprocessing scripts).  
You can find the [main repository of our project here](https://github.com/ViolaineF/immersiveai).
